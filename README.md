# Huffman-Coding

The goal of this project is to implement a form of data compression. That is, given some data, we want to express the same information using less space. For this project, we will specifically focus on compressing text files, so we must first understand how computers represent text internally.

The project supports users' understanding how computers store texts internally, finding different ways to encode characters to minimize the number of bits needed, and making sure the characters that appear the most get the shortest codes.
